# TCM Watch Product Introduction

## Overview
The TCM Watch (Traditional Chinese Medicine Smartwatch) is a revolutionary wearable device that bridges the gap between ancient Eastern wisdom and modern biosensor technology. Unlike standard fitness trackers that only measure heart rate or steps, the TCM Watch analyzes physiological data through the lens of Chinese Medicine.

## Core Technology: Pulse Diagnosis (Mai Zhen)
The device utilizes a high-frequency PPG sensor array to capture the pulse wave form at the radial artery. Our proprietary "Digital Pulse Algorithm" classifies the pulse into 28 traditional types (e.g., Wiry, Slippery, Thready).
- **Wiry Pulse (Xian)**: Often indicates stress or liver Qi stagnation.
- **Slippery Pulse (Hua)**: May indicate dampness or phlegm accumulation.

## Features
1.  **Solar Terms Health Guide**: Provides daily advice based on the 24 Solar Terms (e.g., "Start of Spring").
2.  **Meridian Massage**: Recommends specific acupoints (like Hegu or Neiguan) to press based on current body state.
3.  **Five Element Music**: Plays generative ambient music tuned to the user's element balance (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water).

## Target Audience
-   **Punk Health Youth**: Young people who stay up late but drink goji berry tea.
-   **Wellness Enthusiasts**: Users interested in holistic health.
